23)For a given 3 digit number, find whether it is armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such
 that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Return "Yes" if it is a armstrong number else return "No".
NOTE: 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.
24)Given non-zero two integers N and M. The problem is to find the number closest to N and divisible by M.
 If there are more than one such number,
then output the one having maximum absolute value.
25)Input:
N = 13 , M = 4

12 is the Closest Number to
13 which is divisible by 4.
26)Given two numbers A and B, find Kth digit from right of AB.
Input:
A = 3
B = 3
K = 1
Output:7
Explanation:
33 = 27 and 1st digit from right is 7.
27)Given a positive number X. Find the largest Jumping Number which is smaller than or equal to X.
Jumping Number: A number is called Jumping Number if all adjacent digits in it differ by only 1.
All single-digit numbers are considered as Jumping Numbers. For example 7,
8987 and 4343456 are Jumping numbers but 796, 677 and 89098 are not.
Input:
X = 50
Output:
45
Explanation:
45 is the largest Jumping Number
possible for X = 50.
28)iven a number N, the task is to find the largest prime factor of that number.
Input:N = 24
Output:3
Explanation:24 has 2 prime factors
3 and 2 in which 3 is greater.
29)Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not.
A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number.
Input:
N = 10
Output:0
Explanation:Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which
is not equal to N itself. So, it's
not a Perfect Number.

51)A tech number can be tech number if its digits are even and the number of digits split into two number from middle then add these number 
if the added number’s square would be the same with the number it will called a Tech Number.If the number is split in two equal halves,
then the square of sum of these halves is equal to the number itself. Write a program to generate and print all four digits tech numbers.
